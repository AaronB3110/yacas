summary: Yet Another Computer Algebra System
description: |
  Yacas is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a
  program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It
  uses its own programming language designed for symbolic as well as
  arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library
  of scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations;
  new algorithms can be easily added to the library.
