            Yacas (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a small and highly flexible general-purpose
            Computer Algebra System (CAS). The syntax uses an infix-operator grammar parser. The
            distribution contains a small library of mathematical functions, but its real strength
            is in the language in which you can easily write your own symbolic manipulation algorithms.
            The core engine supports arbitrary precision arithmetic and is able to execute symbolic
            manipulations on various mathematical objects by following user-defined rules. For detailed
            information on yacas features and usage, see <a href="http://www.yacas.org" class="uri">
