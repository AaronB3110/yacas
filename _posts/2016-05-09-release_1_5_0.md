title: Release 1.5.0
teaser: While primarily a cleanup release, new version brings a few enhancements as well.  
author: grzegorzmazur

The release should be fairly non-disruptive for the users, bringing
some minor bug-fixes and modest portion of enhancements. Nevertheless,
distribution maintainers may be somewhat disturbed. Time-proven
buildsystem is ditched, documentation location has changed. Please
consult bundled [packaging templates for RPM, deb and
snap](https://github.com/grzegorzmazur/yacas/tree/2ce27e100b4d494fe0cbd4f6bd49be4862c5527d/packaging)
for new build description and file locations.
