Finally, the wait is over and there's an editor which understands yacas syntax.
Actually, not just an editor, this is [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), hands down the best development
environment ever!

To try it out just download `yacas-syntax-highlighting-1.0.0.vsix` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/grzegorzmazur/yacas-syntax-highlighting/releases),
run
```
code --install-extension yacas-syntax-highlighting-1.0.0.vsix
```
and enjoy writing yacas code in style!
