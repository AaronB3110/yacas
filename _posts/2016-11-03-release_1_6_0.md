title: Release 1.6.0 - Grand Unified Yacas
subheadline: Better. Stronger. Unified
teaser: True to it's codename, the release finally brings together the CAS engine library, text console, graphical interface and yacas kernel for Jupyter Notebook. And adds a complete in-browser CAS for a good measure.

[Yagy](https://github.com/grzegorzmazur/yagy), the Yet Another GUI for
Yacas, and [yacas_kernel](https://github.com/grzegorzmazur/yacas_kernel),
the yacas kernel for [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/),
previously developed as independent packages, have been integrated
into the main yacas codebase. Oh, and one more thing â€“ we
cross-compiled yacas to JavaScript and slapped GUI from yagy on top,
getting a fully yacas-compatible in-browser Computer Algebra System.

Hence, starting from this release, yacas provides:

 * native (C++)
   * CAS engine library (libyacas),
   * text console (yacas),
   * Graphical User Interface (yacas-gui),
   * kernel for Jupyter Notebook (yacas-kernel)
 * platform-independent (Java)
   * CAS engine and text console (jyacas)
 * in-browser (JavaScript generated from C++ sources)
   * CAS engine with Graphical User Interface (yacas-online)
