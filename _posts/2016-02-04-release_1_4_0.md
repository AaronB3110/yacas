title: Release 1.4.0
teaser: This is the first release of yacas after <a href="http://www.yacas.org/migration_github/">moving over</a> to <a href="https://github.com/grzegorzmazur/yacas/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+YacasOrg/posts/f7UGDNqsWEa">license change</a> and switching to the <a href="http://www.yacas.org/">new webpage</a> and <a href="http://yacas.readthedocs.org/">new documentation system</a>. Despite all the changes, yacas keeps up as a small, flexible, portable, backward-compatible, easy to use and extend Computer Algebra System that just makes the computer calculations easy.
